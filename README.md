## 🌌 Overview
The RCA Ω 2027 project re-examines **Dark Energy** and **Dark Matter** as two complementary phases  
of a single cosmological field — the **Resonant Continuum**.  
Phase III (Systematic Validation) establishes statistical, theoretical, and reproducibility verification  
across multiple observational datasets (CMB, BAO, RSD, SNe Ia).

All data and documentation are publicly released under the Aluminous Open Science Charter to ensure  
transparency, auditability, and community replication.

## 🚀 Next Phase — Phase IV (Observational Activation)
**Objective:** Integrate RCA predictions with DESI Final Data Release (2026), Euclid Deep Field Spectra, and CMB-S4.  
**Goal:** Establish the Living Resonance Cycle — bridging physics, philosophy, and verification.
